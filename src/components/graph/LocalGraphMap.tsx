/**
 * A miniature of the writing map: the neighbourhood canvas beside a panel
 * describing whatever node is selected.
 *
 * The division of labour matters. Clicking a node *selects* it — it does not
 * navigate — because a canvas click that silently changes the page is a
 * surprise, and because selection is what lets a reader inspect several
 * neighbours without leaving the page they are on. Navigation is always an
 * explicit link: the action at the foot of the panel. This mirrors how the
 * full GraphBrowser behaves, so the small widget and the large map teach the
 * same interaction.
 *
 * It is also bounded whatever a page's degree: the canvas caps its
 * neighbourhood at `maxNodes` and the panel is sized to the canvas, so a
 * heavily linked page cannot stretch the footer.
