Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

My name is Awni. I am a second year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science at Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/). I am grateful to be advised by Prof. [John Lafferty](https://statistics.yale.edu/people/john-lafferty).

My research interests lie in machine learning theory and methodology, the interface of machine learning and neuroscience, high-dimensional statistics, reinforcement learning, stochastic control and sequential decision making, optimization, and game theory. Recently, I've been interested in relational representation learning and the role of information structures in reinforcement learning.
