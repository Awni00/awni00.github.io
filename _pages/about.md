Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

My name is Awni. I am a second year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science at Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/). I am grateful to be advised by Prof. [John Lafferty](https://statistics.yale.edu/people/john-lafferty).

My research interests lie in statistical machine learning, the interface of machine learning and neuroscience, and reinforcement learning theory. My recent projects have explored 1) models of abstraction via relational representation learning; 2) the role of information structures in reinforcement learning; and 3) memory and retrieval mechanisms in machine learning.
