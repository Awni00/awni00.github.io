Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

My name is Awni. I am a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science at Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/) studying the foundations of machine learning. My wonderful advisor is Prof. [John Lafferty](https://statistics.yale.edu/people/john-lafferty).

My research interests lie broadly in the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and computer science. More specifically, my research aims to study questions of the following flavor:
- What are the architectural mechanisms and inductive biases necessary for efficient learning and strong generalization in different domains?
- What are the fundamental theoretical limits of what is or is not possible to learn under different learning paradigms?
- To what degree can neural networks learn functions and algorithms that can generalize compositionally to out-of-distribution inputs?

Our work tackles these questions through complementary empirical investigation and theoretical analysis. My current research focus is on algorithmic generalization and reasoning in machine learning models.
