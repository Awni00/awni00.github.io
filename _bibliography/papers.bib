  abstract        = {In a sequential decision-making problem, the information structure is the description of how events in the system, occurring at different points in time, affect each other. In particular, for each system variable, the information structure describes the subset of past events which affect it directly. Classical models of reinforcement learning (e.g., MDPs, POMDPs, Dec-POMDPs, and POMGs) assume a very simple and highly regular information structure, while more general models like predictive state representations don't explicitly model the information structure. Real-world sequential decision-making problems typically involve a complex and time-varying interdependence of system variables, requiring a rich and flexible representation of information structure. The control community has long recognized the importance of information structure, leading to the development of the celebrated Witsenhausen intrinsic model, and many impactful works since then. In this paper, we argue for the perspective that explicit representation information structures is an important component of analyzing and solving reinforcement learning problems. Taking inspiration from the control literature, we propose partially-observable sequential teams and partially-observable sequential games as reinforcement learning models with explicit representation of information structure, capturing classical models of reinforcement learning as special cases. We characterize the relationship between the rank of the observable dynamics of a sequential decision-making problem and its information structure through a graph-theoretic quantity of its DAG representation. This gives a clear and interpretable condition in terms of information structure for the tractability of a sequential decision-making problem. Finally, we propose provably sample-efficient algorithms for learning partially-observable sequential teams and games through a parameterization in a generalized predictive state representation.},

  abstract = {A maturing area of research in deep learning is the development of architectures that can learn explicit representations of relational features. In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning representations of hierarchical relations, proposing an architectural framework we call "relational convolutional networks". Given a sequence of objects, a "multi-dimensional inner product relation" module produces a relation tensor describing all pairwise relations. A "relational convolution" layer then transforms the relation tensor into a sequence of new objects, each describing the relations within some group of objects at the previous layer. Graphlet filters, analogous to filters in convolutional neural networks, represent a template of relations against which the relation tensor is compared at each grouping. Repeating this yields representations of higher-order, hierarchical relations. We present the motivation and details of the architecture, together with a set of experiments to demonstrate how relational convolutional networks can provide an effective framework for modeling relational tasks that have hierarchical structure.},

  abstract = {A central challenge for cognitive science is to explain how abstract concepts are acquired from limited experience. This effort has often been framed in terms of a dichotomy between empiricist and nativist approaches, most recently embodied by debates concerning deep neural networks and symbolic cognitive models. Here, we highlight a recently emerging line of work that suggests a novel reconciliation of these approaches, by exploiting an inductive bias that we term the relational bottleneck. We review a family of models that employ this approach to induce abstractions in a data-efficient manner, emphasizing their potential as candidate models for the acquisition of abstract concepts in the human mind and brain.},

  abstract = {An extension of Transformers is proposed that enables explicit relational reasoning through a novel module called the Abstractor. At the core of the Abstractor is a variant of attention called relational cross-attention. The approach is motivated by an architectural inductive bias for relational learning that disentangles relational information from extraneous features about individual objects. This enables explicit relational reasoning, supporting abstraction and generalization from limited data. The Abstractor is first evaluated on simple discriminative relational tasks and compared to existing relational architectures. Next, the Abstractor is evaluated on purely relational sequence-to-sequence tasks, where dramatic improvements are seen in sample efficiency compared to standard Transformers. Finally, Abstractors are evaluated on a collection of tasks based on mathematical problem solving, where modest but consistent improvements in performance and sample efficiency are observed.},

In this work, we study multi-agent learning in stochastic games with general state spaces and an information structure in which agents do not observe each other's actions. In this context, we propose a decentralized MARL algorithm and we prove the near-optimality of its policy updates. Furthermore, we study the global policy-updating dynamics for a general class of best-reply based algorithms and derive a closed-form characterization of convergence probabilities over the joint policy space.},

  abstract = {Many human diseases exhibit a complex genetic etiology impacted by various genes and proteins in a large network of interactions. The process of evaluating gene-disease associations through in-vivo experiments is both time-consuming and expensive. Thus, network-based computational methods capable of modeling the complex interplay between molecular components can lead to more targeted evaluation. In this paper, we propose and evaluate geneDRAGNN: a general data processing and machine learning methodology for exploiting information about gene-gene interaction networks for predicting gene-disease association. We demonstrate that information derived from the gene-gene interaction network can significantly improve the performance of gene-disease association prediction models. We apply this methodology to lung adenocarcinoma, a histological subtype of lung cancer. We identify new potential gene-disease associations and provide supportive evidence for the association through gene-set enrichment and literature based analysis.}
